Question 1

Overall, the times taken to put(k,v) are quite similar for LinearProving and QuadraticProbing
with time increasing linearily as more values are inputted because there exists a greater 
possibility of collisions, and thus, needs more time to probe. 

SeparatingChaining takes the longest time out of the three approaches because it does not handle
collisions, and thus, any values that map to the same index end up forming collisions and lengthning
the list for that specific index.

Question 2

Nothing takes an excessive amount of time.

Question 3

Yes, the times are overall faster for QuadraticProbing101 than the normal QuadraticProbing. 
The reason being that since 101 is a prime number, it reduces the possibility of collisions, even though
the capacity simply increased of 1, and thus since there should be less collisions, then the method
does not have to probe as much, hence it takes less time to execute.
